# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
### Jeremy has been approached by upper mamagement on the data of the new MechaCar. It is unfortunately, there are production problems when it comes to car, and it is stalling the progress of manufacturing. Our job is to help Jeremy perform the following tasks;
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
