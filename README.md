# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
### Jeremy has been approached by upper mamagement on the data of the new MechaCar. It is unfortunately, there are production problems when it comes to car, and it is stalling the progress of manufacturing. Our job is to help Jeremy perform the following tasks;
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### The following image is a result of a linear regression performed on the data gathered.

### The following image is a summary of the linear regression statistics.

### According to the images, we will ask and answer the following questions;
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
* * When we look at the summary, we will see that the intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance will provide a non-random amount of variance.
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
* * When we look at our R-Square values, given that it adjusted to around 68%, we can take into account that 68% percent of the values will be represent by the linear model. Also, that the p-value is around 5.35e-11 or 0.0000000000535, which is significantly smaller than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis that the slope is at zero.
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
* * Given that the R-Square adjusted value is around 68%, it does not effectively predict the mpg of the prototypes. In otherwords, it will make a mistake 1 out 3 times it predicts the mpg.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The following image is specifically looking at the statistics of the PSI of Suspension coils

### The following image is specifically looking at the statistics of the PSI of Suspension coils coming from different manufactoring lots
![Lot Summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Greekman12490/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/main/images/MechaSuspension_LotSummary.PNG)
### According to the images, we will ask and answer the following question;
* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
* * If we look at the data of the first image, the specifications are met with the variance being around 62.3 PSI. However, when we look at the second image, we will see that the first manufacturing lot is below 1 PSI and the second being around 7.5 PSI. What we also notice is that the third lot exceeds 100 PSI maxiumum with its variance. This excessive PSI fails to meet the dictations of the specifications. 
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
### The following images are t-tests on our data. A t-test is used to if there is a significant difference of the means of more than one group

### All lots combined t-test
![T-Test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Greekman12490/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/main/images/t-test%20all%20lots.PNG)
### Individual t-test for Lot # 1
![Lot1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Greekman12490/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/main/images/lot1_t-test.PNG)
### Individual t-test for Lot # 2
![Lot2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Greekman12490/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/main/images/lot2_t-test.PNG)
### Individual t-test for Lot # 3
![Lot3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Greekman12490/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/main/images/lot3_t-test.PNG)

### According to our t-tests, Lot # 3 p-value is less than 0.05, which means we reject the null hypothesis. Given the numbers that have seen in previous images for Lot # 3, we can assume the mean is significantly different than that of population mean of 1500.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

### When we look at cars, people use them for variety of reasons. These reasons can range from personal to work use. We will answer the following questions based on subjective notions;
* What metric or metrics are you going to test?
* * Considering that many people use cars to drive a significant amount of distance, we will consider MPG (miles per gallon) and ground clearance. Why specifically those? Given that gas prices currently (November 2021) are high, the assumption is to get the most milage per gallon of gas the vehicle can hold. For example, if a car goes an average of 30 miles to the gallon and can hold 10 gallons. The car can go 300 miles before a tank refill. Given a commute of 50 miles a day, the individual will fill there gas tank once a week. For ground clearance, given that road conditions currently in the USA have degraded, (potholes) if the car has a higher clearance, it will less likely have impact with the ground when it drives over a pothole.
* What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
* * For the null hypothesis, Mecha will have no differences when it comes to MPG and ground clearance than that of other car manufacturers. For the alternative hypothesis, Mecha will be better than that of the competition when it comes to MPG and ground clearance.
* What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
* * Given that we will be using multiple manufacturers, it is best to use the ANOVA test when it comes to testing. If we only compared Mecha and one other manufactor, a Two-Sample t-test would be best
* What data is needed to run the statistical test?
* * Given that we are comparing multiple car manufacturers to MPG and ground clearance, we will be needing the car make's names, MPG averages of the Car Makes, and averages of the ground clearance per Car Makes (ex - Car Make - Volkswagen, Car Model - Jetta). If we want to be more specific with Car Models, we can do so.
